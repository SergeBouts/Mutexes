    /// The `wait(until:with:)` function is equivalent to `wait(with:)`, except that it fails if the absolute time specified by `threshold` passes (that is, system time equals or exceeds `threshold`) before the condition variable is signaled or broadcasted, or if the absolute time specified by `threshold` has already been passed at the time of the call. When such timeouts occur, `wait(until:with:)` will nonetheless release and re-acquire the mutex referenced by mutex, and may consume a condition signal directed concurrently at the condition variable.
